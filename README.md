# Keeper of the Session

A chrome extension that keeps you logged into connex.

All this does is asynchronously fetch the current page every 5 minutes when you are currently on a connex page.

## Usage

1. `git clone git@github.com:cpjk/keeper_of_the_session.git`

2. Go to chrome://extensions and click "Load unpacked extension".

3. Select the directory you cloned this project into (probably `keeper_of_the_session`).

4. Use connex :crying_cat_face:. Don't get logged out :tada:.
